CSS and Javascript munger for SilverStripe
==========================================

Files included via Requirements will be processed by the CSS_Munger and 
JS_Munger classes instead of the built-in file combining and minification.

By default, caching and minification are turned off for development - this 
depends on the value returned by Director::isDev().
